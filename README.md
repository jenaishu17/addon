This is DSA with SQL addon.     
In this addon-training we use the flipped class methodology of the classroom where each of us are assigned with 3 task and main program everyday we complete these tasks daily in the training session and our trainer will evaluate our progress, based on the progress the marks are allocated.      
  Each day we have Post-Assignment more like a task as homework or assignment.      
  DAY1:   Arrays         
[
Task1:  Implement Array operations,
Task2:  Find Min/Max in the array,
Task3:  Recursive Factorial and Fibonacci,
Main Program:  Build a recursive menu driven array manipulation,
Post Assignment:  Sum of Digits Using Recursive Function 
]        
DAY2:  Two Pointers      
[
Task1:  Reverse the numbers in the array based on two pointers,
Task2:  Declare an array(user-defined),add values,sort it in descending order and save it in a different array,
Task3:  Remove duplicates from a sorted array using two pointers,
Main Program:  Check for palindrome using two pointers,
Post Assignment:  Acquire the target using pointers(Sum of two target=8)
]      
DAY3:  Singly Linked List      
[
Task1:  Build a basic SinglyLinkedList and traversal,
Task2:  Insert at any position in SLL,
Task3:  Delete at any position in SLL,

]      
DAY4:  Doubly Linked List      
[
Task1:  Build a basic DoublyLinkedList and traversal,
Task2:  Insert a node at middle of a DLL,
Task3:  Delete a node at middle of a DLL,
Main Program:  Traverse a DLL from front and vice versa,
